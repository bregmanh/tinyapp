# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

## Features and How to Use

-First time users can register or returning users can simply login to create new links and get access to the stored links. The links previously created by the user are private and are only accessible to them to view upon login.
-Users can delete and/or edit their links.
